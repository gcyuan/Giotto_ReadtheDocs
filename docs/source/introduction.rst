What is Giotto?
#######################

Giotto is a comprehensive and open-source toolbox for spatial data analysis and visualization. 
The analysis module provides end-to-end analysis by implementing a wide range of algorithms for 
characterizing tissue composition, spatial expression patterns, and cellular interactions. 
Furthermore, single-cell RNAseq data can be integrated for spatial cell-type enrichment analysis.
The visualization module allows users to interactively visualize analysis outputs and imaging features. 
Giotto is applicable to a wide range of spatial technologies and platforms.

**Note:** This is the stable but older version of Giotto. For the latest version, please refer to [Giotto Suite](https://giottosuite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). *Warining:* Reinstallation is required in order to use Giotto Suite. Some old functions may not work.

Description 
*************

* Giotto provides a flexible framework for common single-cell processing steps such as:
   
  * Quality control
  * Normalization
  * Dimension reduction
  * Clustering and cell type annotation
  
* To facilitate the analysis of recently emerging high-throughput, but lower-resolution spatial transcriptomic technologies, such as 10X Genomics Visium and Slide-seq, Giotto has 3 implemented algorithms for estimating the spatial enrichment of different cell types by integration of known gene signatures or single-cell RNAseq expression and annotation data.
* Spatial information is retained through the formation of a spatial grid and/or a spatial proximity network, which is used to:
  
  * Identify spatial genes
  * Extract continuous spatial-expression patterns
  * Identify discrete spatial domains using HMRF
  * Explore cell-type/cell-type spatial interaction enrichment or depletion
  * Calculate spatially increased ligand-receptor expression in cells of interacting cell type pairs
  * Find interaction changed genes (ICG): genes that change expression in one cell type due to interaction with a neighboring cell type

* Giotto provides a number of options to visualize both 2D and 3D data and the outcome of Giotto can be interactively explored using [Giotto Viewer](https://qzhudfci.bitbucket.io/spatialgiotto/giotto.viewer.html) which allows you to overlay the obtained results with raw or additional images of the profiled tissue section(s).
